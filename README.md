Basho bench Riak Set extension
==============================

This is a custom driver to aid in benchmarking and testing Riak in a
setting where we have to use different buckets, and add-only Sets.

For more information about basho bench, please see its
[documentation][docs:basho-bench], and the examples herein in the
`examples/` directory.

To build the project, simply type `make`. To run a test, use the
`./basho_bench` binary created, as explained in the documentation.
Generating the summary graphs can be done in the same way as described
there.
